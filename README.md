## Overview

My name is Matt Larsen. I am from the Washington D.C. area and I am curious about the public transportation in the area. There is a prominant public bike company called Capital Bikeshare in the area. To better understand the frequency of use and reliability of the company, I want to create a predictive model that can utilize existing data on all Capital Bikeshare trips. interpretable models that forecast ridership based on historical trends. I am an undergraduate student with a strong interest in sustainable transportation, data-driven planning, and the ways technology can improve city mobility systems. This project allowed me to combine those interests while strengthening my skills in Python, GitHub collaboration, and data analysis. Ultimately, my goal is to build tools that help cities operate more efficiently, support sustainable travel behavior, and make shared micromobility more accessible.
